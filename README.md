Improve the program for Bank of IIT to develop analytics from its clients for its loan application process. Currently records show 600 clients exist and the bank is hoping to expand its clientele and its potential by offering premium loans to deserved grantees.
A new class called Records.java extends the BankRecords.java class to use its instance methods and object array.  Two comparators are used by implementing java.util.Comparator interface to compare various fields for data analysis requirements including:

•	average income for males vs. females 

•	number of females with a mortgage and savings account

•	number of males with both a car and 1 child per location

The results are both displayed to the console and written to bankrecords.txt.
